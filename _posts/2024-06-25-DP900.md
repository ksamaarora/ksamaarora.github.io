### Different Data Formats

- **Structured data:** **fixed schema** - all data have **same fields** or **properties** - mostly **tabular** format

- **Semi-structured data:** has some structure, but will allow for **some variation** between instances - **common format** for semi-structured data is **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** 

- **Unstructured data** - e.g. **docs**, **images**, **audio** and **video** data and **binary files**

### Common File Formats

> #### Delimited text files
- It is a **comma-separated values (CSV)** in which **fields** are separated **by commas**, and **rows** are terminated by carriage **return/new line** 
- First line may include field names 
- Delimited text is **good** for **structured data** that needs to be accessed by a wide range of applications and services in a human-readable format
- E.g.

```
FirstName,LastName,Email
Joe,Jones,joe@litware.com
Samir,Nadoy,samir@northwind.com
```

Other common formats:
  - **Tab-separated values (TSV) and space-delimited:** in which **tabs or spaces** are used to **separate fields**
  - **Fixed-width data:** in which **field is allocated** a **fixed number of characters**

> #### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
- It is a format in which **hierarchical document schema** is used to **define data entities** (objects) that have **multiple attributes** 
- used for **both structured** and **semi-structured data**
- E.g.

```json 
// Customer1
{
  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Jones",
  "address":
  {
    "streetAddress": "1 Main St.",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10099"
  },
  "contact":
  [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555 123-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "email",
      "address": "joe@litware.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

> #### Extensible Markup Language (XML)
- It is a **human-readable format**
- XML uses **tags enclosed** in **angle-brackets (<../>)** to define elements and attributes
- E.g.

```xml
<Customers>
  <Customer name="Joe" lastName="Jones">
    <ContactDetails>
      <Contact type="home" number="555 123-1234"/>
      <Contact type="email" address="joe@litware.com"/>
    </ContactDetails>
  </Customer>
  <Customer name="Samir" lastName="Nadoy">
    <ContactDetails>
      <Contact type="email" address="samir@northwind.com"/>
    </ContactDetails>
  </Customer>
</Customers>
```

> #### Binary Large Object (BLOB)
- **All files** are **ultimately stored** as **binary data (1's and 0's)**, but in **human-readable formats**, bytes of binary data are mapped to printable characters **(ASCII or Unicode)**
- **Common data stored** as binary include **images**, **video**, **audio**, and **application-specific documents**

### Optimized file formats:

| Format       | Type                   | Developed By                 | Key Features                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Avro**     | **Row-based** format       | **Apache**                       | Each record has a **JSON header** describing the **structure** of the binary data, good for **data compression**, and **minimizes storage** and **network bandwidth** requirements.   |
| **ORC**      | **Columnar** data format   | **HortonWorks**                  | Optimizes read and write operations in Apache Hive, contains stripes of data for columns, includes **statistical info** (count, sum, max, min) in footers.            |
| **Parquet**  | **Columnar** data format   | **Cloudera** and **Twitter**         | Contains row groups with column data, includes metadata for **efficient retrieval** of specified columns, specializes in **nested data types**, supports **efficient compression**.  |

### Databases

_**Relational Databases:**_ commonly used to **store and query structured data** - data stored in **tables** that represent **entities**, such as customers, products, or sales orders. **Each instance** of an entity is assigned a **primary key** that uniquely identifies it - and these **keys** are used to **reference the entity instance** in other tables.
- The **tables** are **managed** and **queried** using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**, which is based on an **ANSI standard**, so it's similar across multiple database systems

_**Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL database):**_ are data management systems that **donâ€™t apply** a **relational schema** to data. 

- **Key-value databases:** each record consists of **unique key** and **associated value**, which can be in any format

- **Document databases:** specific form of **key-value database** in which the value is a **JSON document** (which the system is optimized to **parse and query**)

- **Column family databases:** tabular data comprising of **rows and columns**, but can **divide columns into groups** known as **column-families** (holds a set of columns that are logically related together)

- **Graph Databases:** which stores **entities as nodes with links** to define relationships between them

### Transactional Data Processing 

Transactional systems are **high-volume systems** designed to process data quickly. The work performed by these systems is known as **Online Transactional Processing (OLTP)**.

**OLTP** solutions rely on database systems optimized for both **read and write operations** to support transactional workloads. These workloads involve **creating**, **retrieving**, **updating**, and **deleting** (**CRUD**) **operations** on data records.

**OLTP systems** adhere to the **ACID principles** to ensure reliable transaction processing:

| **ACID Principle** | **Description** | **Example** |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Atomicity**      | **Each transaction** is treated as a single unit that either **fully succeeds** or **fully fails**. | A transaction involving **debiting** funds from one account and **crediting** the same amount to another must **complete both actions** **or neither**. |
| **Consistency**    | Transactions transition the database from **one valid state to another**. | The final state of a transaction must **accurately reflect** the transfer of funds between accounts. |
| **Isolation**      | **Concurrent** transactions do **not interfere** with each other and result in a **consistent database state**. | While **funds** are being **transferred**, another transaction checking the **balance** must show **consistent results**, without mixing pre- and post-transfer states. |
| **Durability**     | Once a **transaction** is **committed**, it **remains so**, **even** in the event of a **system failure**. | After the account transfer is complete, the **updated balances** are **preserved** even if the database system is turned off and back on. |

### Analytical Data Processing

1. **Operational Data Extraction**: Data is extracted, transformed, and loaded **(ETL) into a data lake** for **analysis**.
2. **Schema Locking**: **Data** is organized **into schemas of tables**, typically in a **Spark-based data lakehouse** with tabular abstractions over files in the data lake, or in a data warehouse with a **fully relational SQL engine**.
3. **OLAP Models**: Data in the data warehouse may be **aggregated and loaded** into an **online analytical processing (OLAP) model**, or cube. Aggregated numeric values (measures) from fact tables are calculated for intersections of dimensions from dimension tables. For example, sales revenue might be totaled by date, customer, and product.
4. **Querying and Reporting**: Data in the data lake, data warehouse, and analytical model can be **queried** to produce **reports**, **visualizations**, and **dashboards**.

**Types of Data Storage**:

- **Data Lakes**: Storage for **unstructured data** for analytical workloads.
- **Data Warehouses**: Storage for data in a **relational schema** optimized for **read operations**.
- **Data Lakehouses**: Combines the **flexible and scalable storage** of a data lake with the **relational querying** semantics of a data warehouse.

**OLAP Models**:

- Optimized for **analytical workloads**.
- Pre-aggregated, **allowing queries** to **return summaries** quickly.
- **Supports data aggregations** across different levels, enabling **drill up/down** by city, individual address, etc.
