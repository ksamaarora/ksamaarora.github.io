## <a id="aws-cloud-overview"></a><u><i>AWS Cloud Overview - Regions and AZ</i></u> 

### AWS Global Infrastructure:
- AWS **Regions**
- AWS **Availability** **Zones**
- AWS **Data** **Centers**
- AWS **Edge** **Locations**/Points of Presence

> #### AWS Regions

A **region** is a **cluster** of **data** **centers**, which are present all around the world. Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3. 

Choice of AWS region **depends** on **4** **factors**:
- **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements**: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- **Proximity to customers**: reduce latency
- **Availabile services within a Region**: new services and new features aren't available in every Region
- **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

> #### AWS Availability Zones:

**Each region** has **many** availability zones **AZs** (min=3 and max=6). **Each AZ** is one or more discrete **data centers** with **redundant power**, **networking**, and **connectivity**. These are **separate** from each other, so that they are **isolated from disasters**. They are **connected with high bandwidth**, **ultra-low latency** networking and thus all of them when linked together, forms a region.

> #### AWS Points of Presence (Edge Location)

Amazon has **400+ points of presence** (400+ edge locations and 10+ regional caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries. Content is delivered to end users with low latency. 

## <a id="aws-identity-and-access-management"></a><u><i>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</i></u>

It is a **global service** as we are going to **create users** and **assign them to groups**. **Groups only contain users**. **Some** users **don’t belong** to a group. Also a **user** can belong to **multiple groups**.

> ### IAM: Permissions

To **allow users** to use AWS account, **permissions** have **to be given** to them. Users or Groups can be assigned **JSON documents called policies**. These **policies** **define** the **permissions** of the users. In AWS, you **apply** the **least privilege principle**: **don’t** give **more** permissions **than** a user **needs**. 

### <a href="/posts_blogs/blogs_AWS_SAA/UsersandGroupsHANDON" style="color:skyblue;" rel="noopener">IAM Users and Groups Hands On</a>

> ### IAM POLICIES

Assume **3 groups**, Developers, Audit Team and Operations containing **respective users** as shown. All the users **inherit** the policy from their respective user groups. **User not under any group**, gets assigned an **_inline policy_** (i.e. policy assigned to only one user).

> ### IAM Policy Structure

Consists of:
  - **_Version_**: policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
  - **_Id_**: an identifier for the policy (optional)
  - **_Statement_**: one or more individual statements (required)
  
Statement consists of
  - **_Sid_**: an identifier for the statement (optional)
  - **_Effect_**: whether the statement allows or denies access (**_Allow, Deny_**)
  - **_Principal_**: account/user/role to which the policy is applied to
  - **_Action_**: list of actions this policy allows or denies
  - **_Resource_**: list of resources to which the actions applied to
  - **_Condition_**: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

> ### IAM Multi-Factor Authentication Overview

#### IAM - Password Policy

In AWS you can **set** up a password policy:
  - Set a **minimum password length**
  - Include **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters, **numbers**, **non-alphanumeric** characters
  - Allow all IAM users to **change** their own passwords
  - Require users to change their password after sometime (**password expiration**)
  - Prevent **password re-use**
Password policy is helpful **prevent** against **brute-force attacks** on your account. Stronger the password, higher the security for your account. 

> #### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

This is **useful** because even if a **password** is **stolen** or hacked, the account (**root account/IAM users**) is **not compromised**. 

**_"MFA = password you know + security device you own (for MFA generating token)"_** 

The following are the **MFA device options** in AWS:

1. **Virtual MFA Device**:
   - Support for multiple tokens on a single device
   - Examples:
     - Google Authenticator (Phone Only)
     - Authy (Multi-Device)

2. **Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key**:
   - Supports multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
   - Example:
     - Yubikey by Yubico (Third Party)

3. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device**:
   - Provided by Gemalto (Third Party)

4. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device AWS GovCloud (US)**:
   - Provided by SurePassID (Third Party)
