## <a id="aws-cloud-overview"></a><u><i>AWS Cloud Overview - Regions and AZ</i></u> 

### AWS Global Infrastructure:
- AWS **Regions**
- AWS **Availability** **Zones**
- AWS **Data** **Centers**
- AWS **Edge** **Locations**/Points of Presence

> #### AWS Regions

A **region** is a **cluster** of **data** **centers**, which are present all around the world. Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3 

Choice of AWS region **depends** on **4** **factors**:
- **Compliance with data governance and legal requirements**: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
- **Proximity to customers**: reduce latency
- **Availabile services within a Region**: new services and new features aren't available in every Region
- **Pricing**: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page

> #### AWS Availability Zones:

**Each region** has **many** availability zones **AZs** (min=3 and max=6). **Each AZ** is one or more discrete **data centers** with **redundant power**, **networking**, and **connectivity**. These are **separate** from each other, so that they are **isolated from disasters**. They are **connected with high bandwidth**, **ultra-low latency** networking and thus all of them when linked together, forms a region.

> #### AWS Points of Presence (Edge Location)

Amazon has **400+ points of presence** (400+ edge locations and 10+ regional caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries. Content is delivered to end users with low latency 

## <a id="aws-identity-and-access-management"></a><u><i>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</i></u>

It is a **global service** as we are going to **create users** and **assign them to groups**. **Groups only contain users**. **Some** users **don’t belong** to a group. Also a **user** can belong to **multiple groups**.

> ### IAM: Permissions

To **allow users** to use AWS account, **permissions** have **to be given** to them. Users or Groups can be assigned **JSON documents called policies**. These **policies** **define** the **permissions** of the users. In AWS, you **apply** the **least privilege principle**: **don’t** give **more** permissions **than** a user **needs**. 

### <a href="/posts_blogs/blogs_AWS_SAA/UsersandGroupsHANDON" style="color:skyblue;" rel="noopener">IAM Users and Groups Hands On</a>

> ### IAM POLICIES

Assume **3 groups**, Developers, Audit Team and Operations containing **respective users** as shown. All the users **inherit** the policy from their respective user groups. **User not under any group**, gets assigned an **_inline policy_** (i.e. policy assigned to only one user).

> ### IAM Policy Structure

Consists of:
  - **_Version_**: policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"
  - **_Id_**: an identifier for the policy (optional)
  - **_Statement_**: one or more individual statements (required)
  
Statement consists of
  - **_Sid_**: an identifier for the statement (optional)
  - **_Effect_**: whether the statement allows or denies access (**_Allow, Deny_**)
  - **_Principal_**: account/user/role to which the policy is applied to
  - **_Action_**: list of actions this policy allows or denies
  - **_Resource_**: list of resources to which the actions applied to
  - **_Condition_**: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "S3-Account-Permissions",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

> ### IAM Multi-Factor Authentication Overview

#### IAM - Password Policy

In AWS you can **set** up a password policy:
  - Set a **minimum password length**
  - Include **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters, **numbers**, **non-alphanumeric** characters
  - Allow all IAM users to **change** their own passwords
  - Require users to change their password after sometime (**password expiration**)
  - Prevent **password re-use**
Password policy is helpful **prevent** against **brute-force attacks** on your account. Stronger the password, higher the security for your account. 

> #### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

This is **useful** because even if a **password** is **stolen** or hacked, the account (**root account/IAM users**) is **not compromised**. 

**_"MFA = password you know + security device you own (for MFA generating token)"_** 

The following are the **MFA device options** in AWS:

1. **Virtual MFA Device**:
   - Support for multiple tokens on a single device
   - Examples:
     - Google Authenticator (Phone Only)
     - Authy (Multi-Device)

2. **Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key**:
   - Supports multiple root and IAM users using a single security key
   - Example:
     - Yubikey by Yubico (Third Party)

3. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device**:
   - Provided by Gemalto (Third Party)

4. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device AWS GovCloud (US)**:
   - Provided by SurePassID (Third Party)

> ### AWS Access Keys, CLI and SDK

#### 3 Methods to access AWS:
  - **_<u>AWS Management Console</u>_** (protected by **password** + **MFA**)
  - **_<u>AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</u>_**: protected by **access** **keys**
    - It is a tool that **enables** you to **interact** with **AWS** services using commands in **command**-**line** **shell**. 
    - Direct access to public APIs of AWS services. You can develop scripts to manage your resources. 
    - It is **open** **source** and is an alternative to using AWS Management Console. 
  - **_<u>AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)</u>_**: for **code**: protected by **access** **keys**
    - This enables you to **access** and **manage** AWS services **programmatically**. 
    - It supports 
      - **SDKs** (**_JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++_**)
      - **Mobile SDKs** (Android, iOS, ..)
      - **IoT Device SDKs** (**_Embedded C, Arduino, .._**). 
    - Example: AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Python. 

**Note:** Access keys are generated through the AWS Console, and should not be shared. **Users manage** their **own** access keys.

> ### IAM Roles for AWS Services

In AWS, **some services** need to perform **actions** on **your behalf**. To facilitate this, you **assign permissions** to these services **using IAM Roles**.

#### Example: EC2 Instance
Consider an EC2 instance, which functions like a virtual server. If this **instance** needs to **perform actions within AWS**, it requires specific **permissions**. These permissions are **granted** through an **IAM Role**. By assigning an IAM Role to the EC2 instance, you **allow** it to **execute actions** according to the permissions defined in that role.

#### Common Roles:  **EC2 Instance Roles**, **Lambda Function Roles**, **Roles for CloudFormation**

> ### IAM Security Tools

### 1. IAM Credentials
- At **account level**
- This **credentials report** contains a list of all **account users** and the **status** of various **credentials**

[![Screenshot-2024-07-07-at-1-44-29-AM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/BQ6hnPfL/Screenshot-2024-07-07-at-1-44-29-AM.png)](https://postimg.cc/3WsjLRRY)

### 2. IAM Access Advisor: 
- At **user-level**
- Shows **service permissions granted** to a user and when those services were **last accessed** i.e. if a user accesses a service, it specifies which **policy granted permission** and when last accessed
