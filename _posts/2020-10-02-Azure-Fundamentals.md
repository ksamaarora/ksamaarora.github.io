> ### Module 1 - Get Started with Azure AI Services

**Data Science:** focuses on processing and analysis of data, applying statistical technique to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in data

**Machine Learning:** subset of data science - deals with training and validation of predictive models, trains model based on algorithm that exploits relationship between features in data to predict values for unknown labels

**Artificial Intelligence:** usually builds on machine learning to create software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence 

  - **Model training and inferencing:** Training process (analyzes data and determines relationship between features and labels), Inferencing (after training, you can use model to make predictions - called inferencing) 

  - **Probability and confidence score:** Predictions made by ML model on based on probability, in most cases predictions have an associated confidence score that reflects the probability on which the prediction is made 

**Azure Machine Learning service:** cloud based platform to train predictive models from data and publish trained model as services

**Azure OpenAI Service:** is azure AI service for deploying, utilizing, and fine-tuning models developed by OpenAI (company that made chatgpt)

- Data scientists can use Azure Machine Learning to prepare data, run experiments, deploy and manage
- Software engineers may use Azure Machine Learning in following ways (i) train and deploy machine learning model, (ii) 
- Collab with data scientists using common frameworks like Scikit-Learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Azure ML SDKs or command-line interface (CLI) scripts to orchestrate DevOps processes that manage versioning, deployment and testing of machine learning models

**Generative AI:** AI models generate content, generate in the form of text, images, code etc., these models depend on LLM - models often queried with natural language prompts and return impressive accurate response when prompted accurately.
