Cloud is a collection of services hosted on servers in different regions. Compute service refers to services needed for processing or running application with use of compute power.

**Regions and Availability Zones:**

- Region is a physical location somewhere in the world, where they put their data centers, which have the servers that host all of their services.
Currently AWS  has regions in North & South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific.

- Availability Zones : Inside a region we have Azs. Each region has multiple isolated and physically separated AZ in a geographic area. They all have independent power, cooling and physical security and they all are connected to each other via ultra high speed and low latency networks.

E.g. In Sydney region there are 6 datacenters - AWS will group these data centers into North South and West Azs. These Azs name are not shared with the users. These are randomly generated.
