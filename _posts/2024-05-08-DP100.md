Business Understanding -> Data Acquisition and Understanding -> Modelling -> Deployment -> Acceptance 

- **Business Understanding:** Business understanding is quite an imp part however many companies tend to skip it . The decision/product developed as to what should be finalized what not based on is it fullfling the goal or the cost efficiency or is it doing in efficient manner.

- **Data Acquisition and Understanding:** We pull data from data sources like IOT devices and then developing pipelines and then we think about the environment (environment would be the cloud environment how we work with it ) , and thinking about data wrangling, exploring and cleaning. In data exploring we explore all the data available for e.g. in consumer database - exploring all the past purchases, some surveys, customer details etc

- **Modeling:** Starting with feature engineering (different features we would select that would drive us to meaningful conclusion), then model training (we create mathematical formula that would take formulas to change data to give some results), model evaluation (we compare data set that is cleaned and data set that we have manipulated and how good is it and score the model)

- **Deployment:** We then deploy it to production, we put it in a place where we can access the model and then score and use the model to make predictions and evaluate the performance and we also monitor our model 

- **Acceptance:** we will accept the model and determine the consumer we need to market our model to 

> ### RESPONSIBLE AI GUIDELINES:

- Fairness: All systems should be treated fairly without any bias on ethnicity, gender, etc
- Reliability and Safety
- Privacy and Security
- Inclusiveness: All should be included irrespective of â€¦
- Transparency: useful explanation of behaviour of AI systems and components 
- Accountability
