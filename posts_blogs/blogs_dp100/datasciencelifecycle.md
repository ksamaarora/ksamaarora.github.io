- **Business Understanding:**
This involves aligning decisions and product development with overarching goals, cost efficiency, and operational effectiveness.

- **Data Acquisition and Understanding:**
  - This phase begins with gathering data from various sources like IoT devices. 
  - Next, we establish pipelines and consider the environment, typically a cloud-based setup. 
  - Data wrangling, exploration, and cleaning follow. 
  - Exploration involves delving into datasets such as consumer databases, examining past purchases, surveys, and customer details.

- **Modeling:**
  - Feature engineering kicks off this phase, where we select relevant features to derive meaningful insights. 
  - Then, we train models by creating mathematical formulas that transform data into actionable results. 
  - Model evaluation compares the performance of cleaned datasets against manipulated ones to gauge model effectiveness.

- **Deployment:**
Deployment involves putting the model into production, this ensures accessibility for scoring and making predictions. Continuous monitoring of the model's performance is essential post-deployment.

- **Acceptance:**
Finally, the model undergoes acceptance testing to determine its suitability for consumer marketing efforts.
