> **Winning XI**

**Tech Stack:** Python, Web scrapping, Pandas, Power BI Github
- Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from espncricinfo with a Brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics. 
- Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match. Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% of chances to win the game.
