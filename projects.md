Try the live version of the Sorting Visualizer: [Sorting Visualizer live version](https://ksamaarora.com/Sorting-Visualizer/)

[Github Link](https://github.com/ksamaarora/Sorting-Visualizer/tree/main)

This project is a **Sorting Visualizer** that demonstrates the inner workings of various sorting algorithms using a visual representation. The aim is to help people understand how different sorting algorithms compare in terms of efficiency, speed, and the steps they take to sort an array of elements.

<!-- - The travel website offers a user-friendly menu with various options: "Home," which serves as the informative landing page presenting an overview of the travel organization; "About Us," providing a brief introduction to the travel services; "Popular Tours," where three popular tour options are recommended along with their descriptions; and "Explore," which takes users to the "Book Now" form page. 

- The "Book Now Form" is a user-input form that collects essential information, including the user's name, phone number, email, destination, tour choice, number of travelers, and desired travel dates, which on submission would reflect the data of the user in the database connected. -->



> ### 2) Library Management Sysrem using BST

[View Project on Github](https://github.com/ksamaarora/Library-Management-System-using-binary-search-tree)

<!-- - This project is a Library Management System that utilizes the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure to efficiently manage books and their quantities. The system is designed to be user-friendly, offering two main interfaces for both administrators and users.

- Key BST Concepts Applied:

- Key concepts applied include the ability to insert new books into the library, maintaining order based on the book's name, ensuring that the library remains sorted.
- Additionally, in-order traversal of the BST is employed to display the library's books in a sorted manner, making it easier for administrators and users to navigate. The system allows for searching, enabling users to find books and administrators to check for the existence of a book before adding it. Deletion of books is also handled within the BST, ensuring the library's inventory is updated accurately. Furthermore, the system keeps a track of the number of books available at any given time. -->
